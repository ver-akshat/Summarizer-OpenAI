 I am using OpenAI API to summarize arxiv research papers using the url of that research paper and reading it from there and making a summary out of that and saving that in a doc file
 Making use of openai.completions endpoint by providing an appropriate prompt message for summarizing the research paper.

 Further improvements- 
 1.Use better models available in OpenAI platform
 2.Build an interactive app using Stremlit where one can upload any document and get a summary for that.
